        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I gained a passion for computers at an early age which led me to become very tech-savvy. I'm always up to date with the latest technology and interested in finding out how it all works.</p>
        <p>This pursuit was followed by a love for maths and physics. I completed my MPHYS at The University of Portsmouth.</p>
        <p>I have now immersed myself in the world of coding and continue to learn more about the topic.</p>
